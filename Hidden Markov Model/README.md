This repository contains all the programs coded for the assignment on climate pattern modeling with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Offline-2). In this assignment, the climate pattern of a tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean region is modeled using HMM. The HMM parameters are estimated with rainfall estimate observations and the most likely climates sequence is estimated separately with both provided and learned HMM parameters. Viterbi algorithm is implemented for solving decoding problem and Baum-Welch learning algorithm is implemented for solving HMM parameters estimation problem.
